# Who to use it - Node area

First we must download the project to our local and download the .zip file and unzip it in the folder that suits you best.

Inside the .zip you will find 2 folders 

- src
- documentation

> Inside src you will find all the developed code.

> Inside documentation you will find everything that has been generated for this project (for example the Postam Collection file).

Open a console and then inside it go to the folder of your project and enter inside the src folder that you just unzipped.

Once inside the src folder execute this command in the console:

```sh
npm install
```

Then execute the command:

```sh
npm start
```

And in the console should be displayed:

```sh
dotenv-run-script ../.env - node
node obeIndex.js
Server listening on port 4142
```

This means that everything was successful.

# Who to use it - Postman's Area

Once the Postman program has been installed and opened, import the collection located in the documents folder.

The Postman collection has 2 post methods, just press send and you should get a result.

Collection variables have been used in Postman, to improve the scalability of the collection.
